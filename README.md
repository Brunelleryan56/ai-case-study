Case study (Assignement #1, Harvey.ai)
# Harvey.ai

## Overview and Origin
The project/company I have chosen to conduct a case study on is Harvey.ai.

Harvey, established in 2022 out of San Francisco, is an AI company that provides models for law firms. The platform allows attorneys and law firms to quickly review contracts, research law, and find legal precedents. In addition to these basic AI concepts, Harvey offers a suite of AI products including practice areas and workflows.

The company was co-founded by roommates Winston Weinberg and Gabriel Pereyra to lessen legal drudgery in law firms. Weinberg previously worked in litigation at a law firm and Pereyra was a Research/Data scientist.

Harvey has raised over $100 million in venture capital, $80 million of which it scooped up at a $715 million valuation in late 2023 from Elad Gil, Kleiner Perkins, and OpenAI Startup Fund. [Source](https://www.forbes.com/companies/harvey/?list=ai50)

## Business Activities
One of the main problems Harvey is trying to solve is simply to ease the workload of research law and case studies. Using AI to assist with the research and drafting of contracts, etc., can cut down the time it takes them to do it or pay associates to do it. Cutting time on that end may also reduce their client's bill.

Harvey's intended customers are medium to large law firms. They already have partnerships with major law firms like Allen & Overy, one of the world's biggest law firms. While they have the attention of the largest firms in the world, Harvey has launched on Microsoft's Azure Marketplace, offering a lower-priced version of its product catering to small and medium-sized firms.

Some of Harvey's competitors are Leya (Sweden) and Alexi (Canada). Both of these companies were founded before Harvey. Both of these companies offer very similar products to Harvey's. However, during my research, I struggled to find client reviews and reports. Both competitors have raised less than 10% of what Harvey has raised and do not have the backing of large investors like Harvey's Gil, Perkins, and Open AI.

Harvey is built on a version of OpenAI's GPT AI. By starting with general input data from all previously recorded files and legal docs in public records into the GPT model. Once purchased and engaged by a law firm, Harvey AI is then further trained by that specific firm's work products and templates. [Source](https://www.clio.com/blog/harvey-ai-legal/)

## Landscape
Harvey is an innovator in the OpenAI-backed, generative AI legal tech space. Previous legal tech companies have used models similar to a keyword search system around local and public documents. But the breakthrough in this tech is the generative AI model trained in this industry.

## Results
While the company is still less than 3 years old, and still in somewhat of an early access phase, it has managed to gain enormous traction. In February of 2023, Allen & Overy, one of the world's largest law firms, decided to integrate Harvey into its global practice spanning around the world with 43 offices and more than 3,500 lawyers operating in multiple languages.

A month later, PwC announced a global partnership with Harvey giving access to all of its Legal Business Solutions professionals. [Source](https://www.lawnext.com/2024/05/harvey-ai-to-move-out-of-early-access-phase-release-more-affordable-versions-of-its-custom-ai-models.html)

## Recommendations
One service that I would advise offering in the stack is Predictive analytics on case/settlement outcomes. With the right prompts and data inputs, you could get niche down to the demographic of the city where litigation is, the judge on the bench, jury demographic, etc.

This would be a good service to offer just for reference and to assist the firm with a strategy based on what the predictive outcome was. This service to my knowledge would use more data analytics of public records as its main technology utilization.
